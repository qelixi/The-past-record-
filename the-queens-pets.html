  <h1>The Queen who loved cats more than war.</h1>
  <p><em>A peak into the royal palace, where the empire ruled and cats reigned.</em></p>

  <p>Queen Victoria ruled an empire,but her time was devoted to her pets, from dogs and cats to exotic birds to even a parrot.</p>

  <p>From 1837 to 1901, under Queen Vicoria, England saw over 600 dogs across 32 breeds in the royal household. This included the Queens famous King Charles Spaniel, Dash, who was seen in her childhood photos and her pomeranian, Turi, who was her favourite later in life and saw her through to her death.</p>

  <h2>Why They Were Overlooked</h2>
  <p>Women faced strict societal expectations that limited education and access to professional fields. Their work was often published under male names or simply dismissed.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Studying these women shows how history has gaps, and recognizing their contributions today gives a more accurate picture of the past. It also provides inspiration for future generations.</p>
