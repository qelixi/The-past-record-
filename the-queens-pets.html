  <h1>Victoria's Furry Court.</h1>

  <p>Queen Victoria ruled an empire,but her time was devoted to her pets, from dogs and cats to exotic birds to even a camel!</p>

  <h2>Her Pets' Royal Treatment.</h2>
  <p>These regal pets were deeply loved by the Queen,on the day of her coronation on 28 June 1838 she bathed her dog, Dash. The dogs lived in specialized kennels at Windsor Castle. This included a dedicated 'Keeper of the Queen's Dogs' Her favourite dogs would travel with her and had meals with her.</p>
  <p>Cats were often used for pest control in Victorian England. However the Queen ,especially in her old age, developed a great fondness for them. Her favourite cat was named White Heather whom she would knit "a piece of wool". She also insisted on a cat appearing on the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) medals. She believed the were often overlooked or ill-treated.</p>
  <p>Horses were kept in house stables and at the estate farm at Barton they were well cared for, though tsometimes they were considered as working animals. The Queen was keen to promote the welfare of her horses and refused to allow tail docking, this was surgically shortening the tail. She had several favourite horses including a Shetland pony named Alma.</p>
  <p>She also had a pair of Tibetan goats, presented by the Shah of Persia. They were both kept in a royal herd at Windsor. She also had birds, including her parrot Lory given to her by her uncle, Ernest I, in May 1836.</p>
