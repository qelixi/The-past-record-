  <h1>The Queen who loved cats more than war.</h1>
  <p><em>A peak into the royal palace, where the empire ruled and cats reigned.</em></p>

  <p>Queen Victoria ruled an empire,but her time was devoted to her pets, from dogs and cats to exotic birds to even a parrot..</p>

  <p>Another example is Mary Anning, a fossil collector whose discoveries in paleontology helped shape modern science, but she was often ignored by male colleagues.</p>

  <h2>Why They Were Overlooked</h2>
  <p>Women faced strict societal expectations that limited education and access to professional fields. Their work was often published under male names or simply dismissed.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Studying these women shows how history has gaps, and recognizing their contributions today gives a more accurate picture of the past. It also provides inspiration for future generations.</p>
